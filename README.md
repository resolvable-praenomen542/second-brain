<br/>

**Second Brain** is an ultra-fast, invisible desktop assistant built to help professionals worldwide ace their job interviews. It runs quietly in the background, listening to the interview, and generates context-aware, first-person suggestions based on your own resume and the job description.

Powered by [Groq's](https://groq.com) lightning-fast Llama-3 inference and Whisper-large-v3, the entire process—from voice capture to intelligent suggestion—happens in milliseconds.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-Time Voice Transcription**: Uses Whisper-v3 via Groq API to transcribe the interviewer's speech with extremely high accuracy and speed.
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Analyzes the ongoing conversation, your provided resume, and the job description to suggest the best possible answers.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Fully localized interface and AI prompting for English, Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Italian.
- **Invisible Mode**: Built with Electron, it can be minimized to stay out of the way while you focus on the video call.
- **Privacy First**: Your resume, job description, and API keys are stored exclusively in your local machine's `localStorage`.
